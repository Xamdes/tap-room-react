## Notes

Trying to figure out how to update the diplay of a variable after you change it.

## Description

The Main difference I've noticed so far between react and angular is that with react there are less files to go through when writing code as react has the js, html and css combined in the jsx file.

## Install

```
  git clone https://github.com/xamdes/tap-room-react.git
  cd tap-room-react
  npm install
```
